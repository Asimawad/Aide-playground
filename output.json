Your previous solution had a bug and/or did not produce a submission.csv, so based on the information below, you should revise it in order to fix this. Your response should be an implementation outline in natural language, followed by a single markdown code block which implements the bugfix/solution.\n\n# Task description\n\n## Task goal\n\nPredict the sales price for each house\n\n## Task evaluation\n\nUse the RMSE metric between the logarithm of the predicted and observed values.\n\n# Previous (buggy) implementation\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold, train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport joblib\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input data\n    train_data = pd.read_csv(\"./input/train.csv\")\n    test_data = pd.read_csv(\"./input/test.csv\")\n\n    # Prepare features and target\n    X_train = train_data.drop(columns=[\"Id\", \"SalePrice\"])\n    y_train = np.log1p(train_data[\"SalePrice\"])  # Log transformation\n\n    # Convert columns to numeric where possible\n    for col in X_train.columns:\n        if X_train[col].dtype != np.dtype(\"float64\"):\n            try:\n                X_train[col] = pd.to_numeric(X_train[col])\n            except:\n                print(f\"Error converting column {col}\")\n\n    # Prepare test data\n    X_test = test_data.drop(columns=[\"Id\"])\n    y_test = np.log1p(test_data[\"SalePrice\"])\n\n    # Convert columns to numeric where possible\n    for col in X_test.columns:\n        if X_test[col].dtype != np.dtype(\"float64\"):\n            try:\n                X_test[col] = pd.to_numeric(X_test[col])\n            except:\n                print(f\"Error converting column {col}\")\n\n    # Define model and train\n    model = LinearRegression()\n    kfold = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)\n    cv_scores = []\n    for train_idx, test_idx in kfold.split(X_train):\n        X_train_fold = X_train.iloc[train_idx]\n        y_train_fold = y_train.iloc[train_idx]\n        model.fit(X_train_fold, y_train_fold)\n        score = model.score(X_test, y_test)\n        cv_scores.append(score)\n\n    print(f\"Cross-Validation Score: {cv_scores}\")\n\n    # Generate predictions\n    predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n\n    # Save to submission.csv\n    submission = pd.DataFrame(\n        {\"Id\": test_data[\"Id\"], \"PredictedSalePrice\": predictions}\n    )\n    submission.to_csv(\"./submission/submission.csv\", index=False)\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n# Execution output\n\n```\nExecution time: a moment seconds (time limit is 5 hours).\n```\n\n# Instructions\n\n## Response format\n\nYour response should be a brief outline/sketch of your proposed solution in natural language (3-5 sentences), followed by a single markdown code block (wrapped in ```) which implements this solution and prints out the evaluation metric. There should be no additional headings or text in your response. Just natural language text followed by a newline and then the markdown code block.\n\n## Bugfix improvement sketch guideline\n\n- You should write a brief natural language description (3-5 sentences) of how the issue in the previous implementation can be fixed.\n- Don't suggest to do EDA.\n\n\n## Implementation guideline\n\n- <TOTAL_TIME_REMAINING: 4.0hrs 17.0mins 23.626678466796875secs>\n- <TOTAL_STEPS_REMAINING: 21>\n- The code should **implement the proposed solution**, **print the value of the evaluation metric computed on a hold-out validation set**,\n- **AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SAVE PREDICTIONS ON THE PROVIDED UNLABELED TEST DATA IN A `submission.csv` FILE IN THE `./submission/` DIRECTORY.**\n- The code should be a single-file python program that is self-contained and can be executed as-is.\n- No parts of the code should be skipped, don't terminate the before finishing the script.\n- Your response should only contain a single code block.\n- Be aware of the running time of the code, it should complete within 4 hours.\n- All the provided input data is stored in \"./input\" directory.\n- **You MUST submit predictions on the provided unlabeled test data in a `submission.csv` file** file in the \"./submission\" directory as described in the task description** This is extremely important since this file is used for grading/evaluation. DO NOT FORGET THE submission.csv file!\n- You can use the `./working/` directory to store temporary files (e.g., models, intermediate data), but the final `submission.csv` MUST be in `./submission/`.\n- REMEMBER THE `./submission/submission.csv` FILE!!!!! The correct directory is critical for evaluation.\n- The evaluation should be based on 5-fold cross-validation but only if that's an appropriate evaluation for the task at hand.\n\n\n# Data Overview\n\n```\ninput/\n    data_description.txt (523 lines)\n    sample_submission.csv (1460 lines)\n    test.csv (1460 lines)\n    train.csv (1461 lines)\nsubmission/\n\nworking/\n```\n\n-> input/sample_submission.csv has 1459 rows and 2 columns.\nThe columns are: Id, SalePrice\n\n-> input/test.csv has 1459 rows and 80 columns.\nThe columns are: Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2... and 65 more columns\n\n-> input/train.csv has 1460 rows and 81 columns.\nThe columns are: Id, MSSubClass, MSZoning, LotFrontage, LotArea, Street, Alley, LotShape, LandContour, Utilities, LotConfig, LandSlope, Neighborhood, Condition1, Condition2... and 66 more columns\n"
