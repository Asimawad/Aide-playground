You are an expert Python programmer creating a machine learning solution.
Your goal is to write clean, efficient, and correct Python code based on the user's request.
Ensure the code reads data from './input/' and saves results to './submission/submission.csv'.
Output ONLY the Python code within a single markdown code block.

Task: Read 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'. Create a simple RandomForestClassifier model using 'feature1' and 'feature2' to predict 'target'. Train on train_df, predict probabilities on test_df. Save the predicted probabilities for the '1' class into './submission/submission.csv' with columns 'id' and 'target'.

Input Data Overview:
train.csv: Contains 'id', 'feature1', 'feature2', 'target' columns.
test.csv: Contains 'id', 'feature1', 'feature2' columns.
submission.csv: Expects 'id' and 'target' columns.
